Special thanks to HWK, from his [blogpost](https://hwk.fr/blog/acf-transformer-la-selection-des-layouts-du-contenu-flexible-en-modal), I created a WordPress plugin with custom tunings (js+css).

Couldn't contribute anymore to [my first version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bea-beautiful-flexible/) which was then abandoned.

Finally, created [my own plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-beautiful-flexible) for prosperity and to personally follow plugin' support.
